Since the rise in popularity of video-sharing platforms such as Youtube, learning 
new skills from the comfort of one's own home has become more accessible than 
ever. Though such independent learning methods are useful, they lack the 
real-time feedback component of being in the same room with an expert, which is 
why expensive private coaching sessions remain desirable. Accordingly, we propose
Limb-O (orbs for limb movement visualization), a real-time quantitative virtual 
coach application for learning lower-limb motions through motion comparison.
The proposed application turns the practice of things like sports motions into a 
game that highlights imperfections and allows for tracking of progress over time.
A user validation study was run which confirmed that Limb-O outperforms 
traditional video learning methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, by
providing objective feedback that keeps users engaged.
